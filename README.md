d2rq_ensembl_faldo
==================

A d2rq mapping to expose ensembl using FALDO 

Still in EXPERIMENTAL state !

Created using d2rq's generate-mapping on a simplified schema for ensembl,
and manual editing.

Currently works under d2r-server, and can be included as a fuseki graph,
but this needs some (dirty) patching to the d2rq source.
